        <h3 style="font-family:Lucida Console">What is an NFT?</h3>
        <p>Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) are units of data that are stored on a blockchain.
            Non-fungible means they cannot be replaced by another identical item, which
            means they are unique. An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world
            objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online,
            frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same
            underlying software as many cryptos. Although they’ve been around since 2014,
            NFTs are gaining notoriety now because they are becoming an increasingly popular
            way to buy and sell digital artwork. A staggering $174 million has been spent on
            NFTs since November 2017.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>How did NFT start?</h3>
        <p>The CryptoArt category was initiated by the cultural phenomenon such as CryptoPunks,
            Rare Pepe, and CryptoKitties. These pieces of ‘art’ gained notoriety due to the viral
            network effects and desire to pay large sums of money to acquire these pieces. The idea
            of NFTs emerged from what is called a “colored coin”, initially issued on the Bitcoin
            blockchain in 2012-2013. Colored coins are tokens that represent real-world assets on
            the blockchain and can be used to prove ownership of any asset, from precious metals to
            cars to real estate, even equities, and bonds. </p>

        <br />

        <h3>What is the point of owning NFT art?</h3>
        <p>NFTs main use has been found in the digital art world. Digital art ownership has proven
            to be a revolution since the advent of the internet. NFTs can solve just that, allowing a
            secure way to create, store, buy, sell, collect and trade digital assets, prove intellectual
            ownership, protect copyrights and allow direct access to royalties.</p>

    <h2>Importance of Non-Fungible Token</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>There are many reasons. A non-fungible token (NFT) is unique and can represent
                any digital asset on a blockchain (such as Ethereum, Solana, Flow, Tezos, etc.), thus
                making it scarce, provable, and valuable. The advent of NFTs have created a new medium
                for artists and creators to showcase their creations or collections. In turn, a revolution
                is paving the way for artists to create and monetize their work while collectors have full
                transparency into the authenticity and provenance into their purchases.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>NFT assets can take the form of digital art, collectibles, a creative extension of
                music, a synergy between all three, or entirely new and unexplored compositions. Creators
                continue to push the boundaries of creativity using NFTs, adapting them in new and innovative ways.
                NFTs are the new way of creative expression, allowing artists, brands and companies to provide
                authenticity and originality in the rising digital age.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>NFTs are the new way of creative expression, allowing artists, brands and companies
                to provide authenticity and originality in the rising digital age. The future of NFTs is
                full of uncertainty, but we've had a blast being part of this project and integrating animation
                production into this new era of crypto art. NFTs are changing our world by how we communicate
                with one another and transmit information. </p>
        </li>

    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Who can create NFTs?</h2>

    <p>Anyone, from artists to entrepreneurs, art advocates, corporations, authors, videographers,
        social media personalities, and even average Joes and Joannas, can create an NFT. No experience
        is necessary, and as long as someone can prove they created or legally own the content, they can
        mint an NFT. To get started on Portion, check out this step-by-step guide on how to create an NFT
        via either Ethereum or Palm.</p>

    <br />
    <h2>Who Can Purchase NFTs?</h2>

    <p>Anyone and everyone. When someone purchases an NFT, they gain the rights to the unique token
        on the blockchain, connecting their name with the creator's art. The benefit of collecting
        specifically on Portion compared to other platforms is that it automatically provides the
        collector with 500 $PRT for each new purchase. Not only are you acquiring a digital asset,
        but you will also receive compensation for being a Portion collector. In the long run,
        collectors and creators who buy and hold larger quantities of $PRT will then reap the benefits:
        surprise airdrops, exclusive giveaways, priority access, just to name a few.</p>

                    <p>Play-to-earn NFT games in the Philippines give users the chance to generate income
                        through playing. Typically, a player is rewarded with tokens and occasionally NFTs,
                        earning more the longer they play and when they win in battles. Play-to-earn has been
                        especially popular with users in low-income countries as an alternative income or to replace
                        a lost income which in the case of the pandemic delivered some tough financial times in these
                        emerging markets.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Axie Infinity has become one of the most well-known play-to-earn games. The game requires
                        an initial investment to purchase three Axies, or you can receive a free Scholarship from
                        another
                        player or gaming guild. These gaming guilds provide the NFTs on loan to players so they can
                        start
                        to play immediately without investment. The in-game token earnings are then split in a profit
                        share
                        between the player and the guild. A guild utilizing this model and gaining large traction with
                        over
                        5,500 global players is Crypto Gaming United.</p>

        <h2>The History of Non-Fungible Tokens</h2>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">The CryptoArt category was initiated by the cultural
            phenomenon such as CryptoPunks, Rare Pepe, and CryptoKitties. These pieces of ‘art’ gained notoriety
            due to the viral network effects and desire to pay large sums of money to acquire these pieces. Their
            history
            dates back to 2017, when American studio Larva Labs developed CryptoPunks, a series of collectable
            digital characters traded through NFTs, which serve as a good starting point in getting your head
            around the technology.</p>

        <h3>2012-2013: Colored Coins</h3>
        <q cite="https://mattgalligan.com/an-nft-is-not-the-art/">
            Learning how cryptocurrency works is like learning a new language. It is incredibly difficult
            at the beginning, but once it clicks it will stick with you forever.</q>
        <figcaption>—Olawale Daniel</figcaption>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">The idea of NFTs emerged from what is called a “colored coin”,
            initially issued on
            the Bitcoin blockchain in 2012-2013. Colored coins are tokens that represent real-world
            assets on the blockchain and can be used to prove ownership of any asset, from precious
            metals to cars to real estate, even equities, and bonds. Although not as sophisticated,
            this original idea was to use the Bitcoin blockchain for assets like digital collectibles,
            coupons, property, company shares, and more. They were described as new technology and
            gave raw possibilities for the future prospects of utilization.</p>

        <h3>2014: Counterparty</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">In 2014 Robert Dermody, Adam Krellenstein, and Evan Wagner
            founded Counterparty, a
            peer-to-peer financial platform and distributed, open-source internet protocol built
            on the Bitcoin blockchain. Counterparty allowed asset creation and had a decentralized
            exchange, thus providing a way for users to create their own tradable currencies. It had
            numerous ideas and opportunities, including meme trading without counterfeit issues.</p>
        <img src="counterparty.png" alt="counter party" height="250" ;width="750" style="border: 10px solid #36B1C0">


        <h3>2015: Spells of Genesis on Counterparty</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">In April 2015 Counterparty partnered up with the team creators
            of Spells of Genesis.
            The Spells of Genesis game creators were not only pioneers for issuing in-game assets
            onto a blockchain via Counterparty, but they were also among the first to launch an ICO.
            The creators helped fund the development of Counterparty by introducing their own in-game
            currency called BitCrystals.</p>
        <img src="spell of genesis.png" alt="spell of genesis" height="250" ;width="750"
            style="border: 10px solid #36B1C0">


        <h3>2016: Trading Cards on Counterparty</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">In August 2016 new trends began to emerge. Counterparty teamed
            up with Force of Will,
            a popular trading card game, and launched their cards on the Counterparty platform. Behind
            Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic, Force of Will was the 4th ranked card game in North America
            according to sales volume. Their entrance into the ecosystem, where they had no prior blockchain
            or cryptocurrency experience before, signaled the value of putting such assets on a blockchain.</p>
        <img src="trading cards.webp" alt="trading cards" height="250" ;width="750" style="border: 10px solid #36B1C0">


        <h3>2016: Rare Pepes on Counterparty</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">In 2016, memes entered the blockchain. In October of 2016,
            memes started to make their way
            onto the Counterparty platform. People started to add assets to a particular meme called “Rare
            Pepes.” Rare Pepes are a meme featuring an interesting frog character that has acquired an intense
            fanbase over the years. What started out to be a comic character named Pepe the Frog, has now
            steadily become an internet sensation as one of the most popular memes. By early 2017, with
            Ethereum gaining prominence, Rare Pepes started to be traded there as well. Portion's Founder,
            Jason Rosenstein, along with Louis Parker, ran the first live Rare Pepe auction which was held
            at the inaugaral Rare Digital Art Festival. CryptoArt was born with the Rare Pepe Wallet and it
            was the first time creators around the world could submit and sell their own artwork. It was also
            the first time digital art could have intrinsic value.</p>
        <img src="rare pepes.jpg" alt="rare pepes" height="250" ;width="750" style="border: 10px solid #36B1C0">

        <h3>2017: Cryptopunks</h3>
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">As Rare Pepes trading picked up, John Watkinson and Matt Hall,
            the creators of Larva Labs,
            created unique characters generated on the Ethereum blockchain. No two characters would be the
            same and they would be limited to 10,000. The project name, Cryptopunks, was referenced to an
            experiment with Bitcoin in the 1990s and can be described as an ERC721 and ERC20 hybrid.</p>
        <img src="cryptopunks.png" alt="punks" height="250" ;width="750" style="border: 10px solid #36B1C0">

        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">ERC20, the most common Ethereum Token Standard, has rules that
            allow tokens to interact with
            each other, but is not the best for creating unique tokens. Enter, ERC721, which had a purpose to
            be the standard for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain. ERC721 assists in tracking ownership and
            movements of individual tokens from a single smart contract.</p>

        <blockquote cite=https://blog.portion.io/the-history-of-nfts-how-they-got-started />
        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">CryptoKitties NFTs hit the ground running using ERC721. They
            are a blockchain-based virtual
            game that allows players to adopt, breed, and trade virtual cats using Ethereum.They exploded into
            popularity and landed features on major news stations including CNBC and Fox News. CryptoKitties
            was created by a Vancouver-based company called Axiom Zen and quickly went viral, earning funding
            from top investors due to their rise in users. Axiom Zen later spun off CryptoKitties into Dapper Labs.</p>

        <p style="padding-left:100px;padding-right:100px">The seemingly underground movement that was taking the crypto
            community by storm has slowly been
            transitioning into more mainstream art. This transition reached an inflection point in Valentine’s day
            2018 when artist Kevin Abosch partnered with GIFTO for a charitable auction. The partnership led to a
            $1M transaction of a beautiful piece of CryptoArt called The Forever Rose. Mr. Abosch continued to
            raise the stakes when he started using a combination of the Ethereum blockchain with his blood in a
            project called “IAMA Coin”. Abosch has not been the only artist adopting this exciting form of
            expression. It has slowly been gaining traction with artists exciting to push their creative boundaries.</p>
