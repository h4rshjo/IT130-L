                    <h3>What is Cryptocurrency?</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which
                                makes it
                                nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are
                                decentralized networks
                                based on blockchain technology—a distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of
                                computers. A
                                defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any
                                central authority,
                                rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a network that is distributed
                                across a large number
                                of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of
                                governments and
                                central authorities. Experts believe that blockchain and related technology will disrupt
                                many industries,
                                including finance and law.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers and
                                decentralized systems
                                that do not collapse at a single point of failure. While the disadvantages of
                                cryptocurrencies include
                                their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in
                                criminal activities.

                <h3>Understanding Crypto</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems.
                            They enable
                            secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. "Crypto" refers to the
                            various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries,
                            such as
                            elliptical curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            Cryptocurrencies can be mined or purchased from cryptocurrency exchanges. Not all ecommerce
                            sites
                            allow purchases using cryptocurrencies. In fact, cryptocurrencies, even popular ones like
                            Bitcoin,
                            are hardly used for retail transactions. However, the skyrocketing value of cryptocurrencies
                            has made
                            them popular as trading instruments. To a limited extent, they are also used for
                            cross-border transfers.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is blockchain
                            technology.
                            As its name indicates, blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks or an online
                            ledger. Each
                            block
                            contains a set of transactions that have been independently verified by each member of the
                            network.
                            Every
                            new block generated must be verified by each node before being confirmed, making it almost
                            impossible to
                            forge transaction histories.The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by the
                            entire
                            network of
                            an individual node, or computer maintaining a copy of the ledger.

                            Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, such as supply chain,
                            and
                            processes such as online voting and crowdfunding. Financial institutions such as JPMorgan
                            Chase &
                            Co. (JPM) are testing the use of blockchain technology to lower transaction costs by
                            streamlining
                            payment processing.

                <p>
                    In recent years, the investment and technology worlds have become saturated with cryptocurrencies,
                    blockchain apps, and related ventures and projects. In spite of the tidal wave of new digital
                    currencies that has transformed the market, however, there has remained a single digital currency
                    that has held the attention of the public more than any other: bitcoin (BTC). Many investors
                    consider bitcoin to be the original cryptocurrency.

                    Founded in 2009 by a programmer (or, possibly, a group of programmers) under the pseudonym Satoshi
                    Nakamoto, bitcoin ushered in a new age of blockchain technology and decentralized digital
                    currencies. Satoshi's whitepaper outlining bitcoin also describes the concept of blockchain
                    technology for the first time, saying that "the network timestamps transactions by hashing them into
                    an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without
                    redoing the proof-of-work."

        <h3>Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Thirteen years ago a person or group using the name Satoshi Nakamoto released a paper describing a
                    new software system called bitcoin. Today bitcoin is worth more than $1 trillion and has sparked a
                    phenomenon that, its proponents believe, might rewire the entire global financial network.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    On Oct. 31, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto sent a nine-page paper to a group of cryptographers outlining a
                    new form of “electronic cash” called bitcoin. At the time nobody cared about Nakamoto’s identity.
                    Most of the people in that group were skeptical of the bitcoin idea itself. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    On Jan. 9, 2009, Nakamoto launched the bitcoin network. Mr. Finney was one of the few who was
                    intrigued by it, and in the early weeks the two worked remotely to get the network running. The
                    first bitcoin transaction went from Nakamoto to Mr. Finney. For about two years, as bitcoin slowly
                    grew, Nakamoto wrote on message boards and privately exchanged emails with developers. In December
                    2010, Nakamoto stopped posting publicly, and stopped talking with developers in 2011. Nakamoto
                    passed leadership of the project to Gavin Andresen, a software developer. </p>
